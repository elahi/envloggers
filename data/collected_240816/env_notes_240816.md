# ENVLOGGER deployment notes

Deployed

Recovered 15 August, downloaded 16 August after some time in the seatable. 

In the seatable (after pickup on August 15), the most reliable comparisons (among 3 evnloggers and the minidot) will be after 9am on 16 August (after I had placed them at the same level / position in the seatable). Prior to that, they were in the same seatable just haphazardly positioned.
