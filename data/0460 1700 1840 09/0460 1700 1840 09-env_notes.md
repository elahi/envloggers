# ENVLOGGER deployment notes

## 0460 1700 1840 09 (Logger E)

Deployed
15 Dec 2022 - deployed to 1m below the surface buoy at 100m on the HMLR cable. 

I dove on 26 Jan 2023 with Kersten, and the buoy was still attached. But sometime between then, and 10 (?) Feb 2023, the surface buoy was gone - pulled out by winter storms. 

Recovered
17 Feb 2023 - logger was recovered by Jennifer Yin; buoy was tangled in MacAbee kelp. 

I received it around 1pm, and placed it in freshwater rinse with minidot till 5:30pm. Then I took them both home to download.
